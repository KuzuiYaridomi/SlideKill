**Slide KiLL**

A fast-paced parkour action prototype built in Godot

Slide KiLL is the first ever game I’ve made since game development started to peak my interest.
I started with Godot from the very basics and built this game from scratch.
This project is also a submission for the Hack Club – Midnight event.

**What is Slide KiLL?**

Slide KiLL is an in-development parkour action game :D
The physics are kind of wanky, chaotic, and high-speed, because its my first time dealing with so many features at once and may end up creating unpredictable moments.

You can slide at insane speeds, bounce off surfaces, and even ram into enemies so hard that they instantly die.
Your movement, momentum, and timing create the main combat system.

**Key Features**

*High-speed parkour movement*: sprinting, jumping, sliding, momentum stacking.

*Slide-to-kill mechanic* — hit an enemy fast enough/ sliding into the enemy that they just die..

rigidbody3D physics-driven gameplay.

Minimalistic, created entirely in Godot 4.5.

Continually updated as development continues.

**Current Status:**

This project is under active development.
More levels, polish, improved movement, enemy AI, UI systems, and weapons will be added over time.

🛠 Engine

Built with Godot Engine 4.5
(100% GDScript)

*Produced as a learning project at first. Now submitting into the event **Midnight** Hosted by **Hack Club***
